1. R. L. Peurifoy, P.E,. W.B. Ledbetter, P.E,. and C.J. Schexnayder, P.E."Construction Planning, Equipment, and Methods", The McGraw Hill, Inch, 1996.
Example 001: 

A piece of construction equipment costs $45'000 to purchase. Fuel, oil, grease, and minor maintenance are estimated to cost $12.34 for each hour that the equipment is used. The tired cost $3'200 to replace (estimated to occur every 2'800 hours of use), and major repais of $6'000 are expected after 4'200 hours of use. The piece of equipment is expected to last for 8'400 hours, after which it will have an estimated salvage value of 10% of the purchase price. How much should the owner of the equipment charge, per hour of use, if he expects to use the piece of equipment about 1'400 hours per years? Assume an annual interest rate of 15%.


Example 002: A contractor calculates that she will have the following cash flow overdrafts on a construction project. These overdrafts are due to the delays in receiving progress payments from the owner and because retainage is being held by the owner until completion of the project. If the contractor's cost of money is 2% per month, how much total interest will have to pay as a result of these cash flow overdrafts?

Month 1   -$45'200
Month 2   -$56280
Month 3   -$67300
Month 4   -$35600
Month 5   -$22800
Month 6   -$8700
Month 7   +$12450
Month 8   +$223430
